# firewall_java
A core component of Illumio’s product is a host-­‐based firewall. As a simplified model, consider a firewall to be a system which is programmed with a set of predetermined security rules. As network traffic enters and leaves the machine, the firewall rules determine whether the traffic should be allowed or blocked.
